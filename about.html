            <p>A tradition common to many of the largest religions in the world is that of the pilgrimage: a journey one undergoes to strengthen their spirituality, typically by physically travelling to destinations of significance to their faith, or metaphorically travelling into their own beliefs and sense of morality. A pilgrimage is supposed to strengthen your connection to your faith by bringing you closer to your gods, by surrounding yourself with physical manifestations of the power of your beliefs, usually in the form of grandiose monuments and temples. Pilgrimages to the Holy Land and Bodh Gaya still happen, but many parts of the developed world, Montreal included, are becoming more and more devout to a new higher power: the World Wide Web.
                <br>
                <br> Why pray to a god who will probably never answer your plees when Siri is always just a tap, swipe, and query away from telling you where to get the best cappuccino in town? The only commandments you’ll be following are Buzzfeed’s “Ten Commandments for Twentysomethings” including such essentials as “You shall not type the name of your ex in the Facebook search bar”. With the God of the Internet, you don’t need faith to justify his existence; his veins run through the infrastructure of our homes and cities, but as disciples of the web, we sometimes forget that, likening the internet to some immense invisible spectre hovering over us all. Perhaps we too must embark on a pilgrimage, to remind ourselves that the internet is a physical being, that it lives all around us.
                <br>
                <br> Our idea for this project is to create a mobile website that guides you on a pilgrimage around Montreal to the physical manifestations of the internet, think cathedrals and shrines to monolithic data centers and internet cafes. If it’s not apparent already, the whole idea is very tongue-in-cheek as the internet’s physical extension serves no aesthetic purpose, and the destinations are hardly intended to be visited (at least as far as data centers go). However, inspired by the concept of psychogeography and finding serenity in the everyday, we wanted to create a narrative that encourages travel around Montreal to places you’ve probably had no reason to go to, by routes you’ve never had any reason to take. With widespread and constant access to the world in our palms, it’s easy to become disconnected from our surroundings and travel through life in static cycles. Come back to reality for a little while, and go on a journey in the name of our savior Tim Berners-Lee.
