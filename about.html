            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A tradition common to many of the largest religions in the world is that of the pilgrimage: a journey one undergoes to strengthen their spirituality, typically by physically travelling to destinations of significance to their faith, or metaphorically travelling into their own beliefs and sense of morality. A pilgrimage is supposed to strengthen your connection to your faith by bringing you closer to your gods, by surrounding yourself with physical manifestations of the power of your beliefs, usually in the form of grandiose monuments and temples. Pilgrimages to the Holy Land and Bodh Gaya still happen, but many parts of the developed world are becoming more and more devout to a new higher power: the World Wide Web.

            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Why pray to a god who will probably never answer your plees when Siri is always just a tap, swipe, and query away from telling you where to get the best cappuccino in town? The only commandments you’ll be following are Buzzfeed’s “Ten Commandments for Twentysomethings” including such essentials as “You shall not type the name of your ex in the Facebook search bar”. With the God of the Internet, you don’t need faith to justify his existence; his veins run through the infrastructure of our homes and cities, but as disciples of the web, we sometimes forget that, likening the internet to some immense invisible spectre hovering over us all. Perhaps we too must embark on a pilgrimage, to remind ourselves that the internet is a physical being, that it lives all around us.

            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This site will guild you on a pilgrimage, if you choose to accept it, around some spots around Montreal that signify the pillars of the internet as we know it: electricity, data centers, service providers, and open public access. Your current location and your destniation are indicated on the map. Whenever you want to check how close you are, tap on the location marker icon at the bottom center of the screen to update your location. When you are within range of your location, tapping on the icon will bring up that location's narrative, a guest log to leave your insight and a prompt to continue.
