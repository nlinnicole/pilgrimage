            <center><p>It is our pleasure to welcome you to the church of our divine Entertainer, the Internet. By joining us here today, itâ€™s clear you are already a disciple, but it is time to affirm your devotion and bring your soul closer to the online. We invite you to embark on a pilgrimage to the shrines of his greatness, to find a deeper connection with Him and feel His omnipresence. While you should never lose sight of your destination, the true undertaking is your journey within; we encourage you to wander. But do not be afraid, for you are never alone. We will be with you spiritually and wirelessly, guiding you on the path to enlightenment.</p>

            <p>When you are ready, we shall commence with paying tribute at the roots of His influence, the energy from which he thrives. We will rejoin you when you arrive there. Godspeed.</p></center>
